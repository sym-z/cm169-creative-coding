				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>I wanted to make an interactive grammar builder for an L-System that users can experiment with and share their results by sharing the keystrokes used to build their patterns.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</h3>
				<p>As the user types, their input is displayed at the top of the canvas, and is subsequently fed as input to the system of rules employed by my L-System. Each letter on the keyboard corresponds to either a combination of multiple rules or a singular rule which is then drawn to the canvas. Try pressing the same letter repeatedly for beautiful effects!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h3>
				<p>As much as I loved this assignment and putting it together, it was incredibly hard to do so because I am currently sick with Covid. I was able to piece together my idea luckily and I am incredibly happy with the resulting program. Due to my fatigue I wasn't sure if I would have enough strength to see my vision through to something I am happy with, but luckily I did just that.</p>
