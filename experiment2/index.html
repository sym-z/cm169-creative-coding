			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art - Shader Fun</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="canvas-container">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
				</div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>I wanted to be able to write shader code for P5.js, and create intresting color variations with mouse control.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works.</h3>
				<p>By using WEBGL mode, I am able to write a Vertex and Fragment shader in GLSL languange and call the p5 function "shader()" which takes my shader as a parameter</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h3>
				<p>This project was due in part to me getting a large portion of the way through this assignment and having to start over. Not all was lost, because now I understand how shaders can be programmed into P5 sketches!</p>

			<h1>Experiment 2 - Animation - Setting Pixels, Layering with a Sense of Decay</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="canvas-container2">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
				</div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>With this experiment I wanted to create a lifeless feeling pattern generator that uses noise and trig functions to layer compositions onto the canvas. Click the screen to see the patterns and use A,S,and D to switch through the three variations.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works.</h3>
				<p>Using the code I started with in my Imitate step, I used the way that noise was generated to set pixels in correspondance to their location when used as input to trig functions.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h3>
				<p>My least favorite of the three. As much as I like the patterns that were generated, I had a lot more eureka moments when working on sketch1 and sketch3.</p>

			<h1>Experiment 2 - Interactivity - Most Valuable Letters</h1>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<div id="canvas-container3">
					<!-- canvas will be added here -->
				</div>
                <div class="fullscreen-box">
                    <button id="fullscreen">Fullscreen</button>
                </div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>A typing visualization that emphasizes commonly used lexicons in a satisfying manner. Type words and watch the visualization. Note: Do not use the space bar, it scrolls the screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works.</h3>
				<p>By using an array and p5's unchar() function that turns the key input into its integer representation, I am able to keep track of how many times each letter has been typed, and increase its size accordingly, all while persisting even after other letters are typed.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</h3>
				<p>I really loved how this sketch turned out. It looks beautiful, and it uses a lot of coding habits that I carried over from working with C-like languages, which are my favorite to work with.</p>
