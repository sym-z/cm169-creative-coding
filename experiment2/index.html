				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>I was aiming to write a shader that applies a CRT-like effect on my previous drawing, and also brightens and darkens the image automatically.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works.</h3>
				<p>I wrote a fragment and a vertex shader that would darken every other line of the image, and then applied additional light value modification by altering the color based on the sin() of the program's runtime.</p>
				<p>ChatGPT was very helpful in doing so, and the conversations I used are documented in the comments of the source code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>This section was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be, and often GPT provided a great start, but incredibly unhelpful assistance with the details, the biggest help to fix errors was copying my code into p5.js' web editor, and messing around until I manually fixed the origin difference between the buffer and the sketch.</p>
