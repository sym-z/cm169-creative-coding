				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>This project was done partly to visualize the data in the task list being used for my capstone project, but also as a possible way for my team members to get a list of the tasks that they were assigned to.</h3>
				<p></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>I converted our Google Sheets spreadsheet into a CSV file and used P5's Table object to parse and visualize it. I create my own Table object when the user of this program wants to download a team member's tasks, and use the saveTable() function to allow them to download it.</h3>
				<p></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>I feel this was a really interesting way for my team and I to reflect on our work so far in the capstone, and allow each team member to see the tasks that they were assigned to easily and without editing the original task list.</h3>
