				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</h3>
				<p>I wanted to create a fun, easy to use synthesizer that emphasized experimentation and play. Try playing Ode to Joy by typing: SSDFFDSAMMASSAA SSDFFDSAMMASAMM!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</h3>
				<p>I used the PolySynth module that is built into P5, and created a visualization that represents the current note being played and its ADSR.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the
					successes of the experiment.</h3>
				<p>I had a lot of fun putting this experiment together, as working with synthesizers is a hobby of mine and I have always been curious as to how difficult it would be to program something like this up.</p>
