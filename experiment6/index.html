				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>A mixture of an L-System and a Caesar cipher encoder/decoder. Write messages to see a random encoding, share the message and shift with friends to share your art!</h3>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>I combined a Caesar cipher creator using input boxes and buttons with my previous work using L-Systems and built something brand new! A way of sending hidden messages and art at the same time!</h3>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>I had a good time putting this together, due to personal circumstances I really didn't have as much time as I would like. School has been pretty stressful and I have been trying to balance personal life stuff with school and I wish I had more time to brainstorm creating something brand new, but I am pretty happy with the way this turned out!</h3>
