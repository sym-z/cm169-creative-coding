My Submission for Experiment 5: 3D Graphics for the class CMPM169: Creative Coding during the Winter 2025 Quarter at University of California: Santa Cruz.

Inspired from the games I played during my childhood and my love for retro technology.

NOTE: Small Typo is in the video where I refer to the art software I used to make the textures as Aesprite instead of Aseprite.
