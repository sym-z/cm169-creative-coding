				<h2>Description</h2>
				<h3>I wanted to replicate and provide a showcase of the type of 3D graphics used in video games that are near and dear to my heart, and dig deep into how to bring those to life. Above is the 3D model of the environment I used in the project, but the main "meat" of the project is showcased in the YouTube link provided above this section.</h3>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<h3>Using tutorials found online, I was able to start my journey into learning the 3D modelling software Blender, and showcase a type of art that I am very close to. I replicated Affine Texture mapping using Geometry Nodes, Vertex Snapping using Attributes that Displace and Distort the mesh, and Vertex Shading using the built in Vertex Painter. I drew all of the textures myself using the software Aseprite, and mapped them onto the meshes.</h3>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<h3>This was one of my favorite projects I've done for this class. I have wanted to learn Blender for the longest time to create animations and make models and environments like this but life has always seemed to get in the way. By motivating myself by making this advent into Blender a submission for an assignment, I was able to learn so much more than I ever thought was possible.</h3>
